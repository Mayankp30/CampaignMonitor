Oh, it's just me, myself and In Solo ride until I die
Cause I got me for life Oh I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold I got that fire in my soul

Oh, it's just me, myself and I and Solo ride until I die
Cause I got me for life Oh I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold I got that fire in my soul

it's just me, myself and I it's just me, myself and I it's just me, myself and I
it's just me, myself and I.]
